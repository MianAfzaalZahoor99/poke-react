## Features

- Display a list of Pokemon with their names and images.
- Click on a Pokemon to view details (name, height, weight, types).
- Persistent state using `redux-persist` to retain the selected Pokemon even after refreshing the page.
- Error and loading handling for API requests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>= 14.x)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MianAfzaalZahoor99/poke-react.git
   cd poke-react
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the application locally, use:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the app in development mode on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following environment variable:

```plaintext
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://pokeapi.co/api/v2
```

This will allow you to configure the base URL of the API easily.

## Testing

This project uses **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit testing. To run tests, use:

```bash
npm test
```

The test coverage is designed to meet at least 60%, covering both components (`PokemonList` and `PokemonDetail`) with scenarios for loading, error handling, and basic rendering.

### Test Files

- `PokemonList.test.tsx`: Tests the `PokemonList` component for loading state, error state, and rendering of Pokemon items.
- `PokemonDetail.test.tsx`: Tests the `PokemonDetail` component to display selected Pokemon details and handles loading and error states.

## API References

This project uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch data:

- **GET /pokemon?limit=10**: Fetches a list of Pokemon.
- **GET /pokemon/{name}**: Fetches details for a specific Pokemon.

Example API endpoints:

- List of Pokemon: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=10`
- Pokemon Details: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/charizard`

## Folder Structure

This project is structured to ensure clean code separation and modularity:

- **src/app**: Contains the Redux store configuration.
- **src/components**: Holds React components, including `PokemonList` and `PokemonDetail`.
- **src/features/pokemon**: Contains Redux slices, RTK Query API, and types specific to the Pokemon feature.
- **src/tests**: Contains all the test files for components.
- **src/index.tsx**: Entry point for the application.
- **src/App.tsx**: Main component to render the layout.
